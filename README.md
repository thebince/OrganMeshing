# OrganMeshing

Implementing a function for dividing a 3D mesh of an organ, which takes two input arguments 1) a triangulated surface, represented by a list of vertices and a list of triangles, and 2) a scalar value, representing a sagittal plane. This function returns two lists representing two triangulated surfaces separated by the specified sagittal plane. Triangulation is done using marching cubes algorithm.
